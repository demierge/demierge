## 📂 Projects

### [MedGPT - Fine-Tuned Chatbot for Medical FAQs](https://github.com/demierge)

- Fine-tuned the open-source **LLAMA-2-7B** model on verified medical FAQ datasets using **LoRA** for parameter-efficient training.
- Implemented **contextual memory** to enable multi-turn conversation flow and improve coherence.
- Applied **prompt engineering** and factual validation to minimize hallucinations and ensure reliability.
- Evaluated model performance using **BLEU, ROUGE**, and human accuracy metrics.
- Deployed a user-friendly **Streamlit** interface for real-time, interactive medical query resolution.

### [MedRAG - Custom Retrieval-Augmented Generation System](https://github.com/demierge)

- Designed an end-to-end **RAG pipeline** combining vector-based retrieval (**FAISS**) with an open LLM for healthcare document querying.
- Utilized **sentence embeddings** for semantic search and contextually accurate response generation.
- Implemented **chunking, metadata filtering**, and citation tracking to enhance factual grounding and transparency.
- Integrated an interactive **Streamlit** interface for uploading and querying medical research PDFs.
- Optimized retrieval quality and reduced hallucination through **context-window tuning** and response validation.
