# LinkedIn Post Drafts for Portfolio Launch

## Option 1: The "Tech-Savvy / Themed" Approach (Recommended)
**Headline:** Entering the matrix... 🟢 My new terminal-themed portfolio is live!

**Body:**
Just deployed my new personal portfolio! 🚀

I wanted to build something that reflects my daily environment as a developer, so I ditched the standard layouts and went for a fully interactive **Terminal/CLI themed** experience.

👨‍💻 **What's inside:**
- **Interactive Command Line**: Navigate my journey like a dev.
- **AI/ML Projects**: Deep dive into my work with **MedGPT** (Fine-tuned LLAMA-2) and **MedRAG**.
- **Tech Stack**: Built with React.js, but styled with pure CSS for that retro terminal feel.

I’m currently looking for internships and opportunities in AI Engineering and Full Stack Development. If you're hiring or just want to talk about LLMs and RAG pipelines, let's connect!

## Option 2: The "Professional & Direct" Approach
**Headline:** Excited to share my new portfolio website! 🌐

**Body:**
I’ve recently updated my portfolio to showcase my latest work in Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering. 

It features my recent deep learning projects:
🔹 **MedGPT**: A fine-tuned LLAMA-2 Chatbot for medical FAQs.
🔹 **MedRAG**: A custom RAG pipeline for querying healthcare documents.

I designed the site to be functional and unique, featuring a terminal-style interface that makes browsing my experience a bit more fun.

I am open to internship opportunities and eager to apply my skills in generative AI and software development. Feedback is always welcome!
